## Description

This exercise illustrates the use of CSS and JavaScript to capture the onmousemove event and redirect mouse pointer coordinates into the position of the eyeballs. This effectively simulates eye movement that tracks the pointer as it moves around on the page. Created in week 8 of the course, this is a fun way to experiment with drawing shapes using only CSS. The face on the page is constructed entirely with CSS, no image files involved. This makes the page load faster, and is much more versatile way of creating illustrations than might appear at first.

## How to Run

- Download the repository onto your machine as a zip file.
- Unzip the file.
- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Move your mouse pointer to make the eyes track its movement.

You can also see a working demo <a href="https://lkmitx.github.io/eye-exercise/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Further development of this repository could include the following:

- [ ] Further develop styles for the page to create a more advanced illustration of a face.
- [ ] Allow user to select some of the features of the face so as to build their own version.
- [ ] Add user to change the colors that are in use.
- [ ] Allow user to freeze the eye movement when the user clicks the mouse.
- [ ] Allow user to restart the eye movement when the user click the mouse a second time.
